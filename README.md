# Call Agent Example
This repository houses an example application to create outbound calls with an agent and set up a number so an agent can answer it.

This is designed to be used with Fluents.ai and it is expected that you already have an account. For this demo, you'll need both an API key and a number that you have previously registered with Fluents.ai

## Getting Started
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
